# Inbox-Impact
Inbox Impact is a Java app that calculates and visualizes your email's carbon footprint (sending, storage, reading) based on size/volume. It displays charts, saves data for trend tracking, and provides tips (like avoiding large attachments) to help users reduce their digital energy use and CO2 emissions.
